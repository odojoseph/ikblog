            <p><br>
            Intercession, being at the heart of evangelization and mission, is well rooted in the Catholic tradition. It concerns all Christians, not just those who are members of the Catholic Charismatic Renewal of Nigeria. As St. Paul enjoins the Ephesians Christian community to “Pray in the Spirit at all times in every prayer and supplication.” (Ep 6:18). Meanwhile, in the Catholic Charismatic Renewal, the Intercessory Ministry (IM) is specially carved out to show commitment to this sacred duty.
            <br><br>Ministries at other levels of the Renewal, such as ‘Healing Ministry’, ‘Deliverance Ministry’, and ‘Praying Ministry’, fall under the STEWARD MINISTRY, and their members to be known as ‘intercessors’. Their role in the CCRN is to PRAY, not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others - specifically for the Church and for the world at large. At Prayer Meetings, members of this ministry anchors the period allotted for praying for intercessions and particular needs of people.
            <br><br>This ministry requires members who are committed to growth in holiness, love for Personal Prayer, Word of God, Sacraments and Fellowship, and a continuous disposition to a intimate communion with God. Spiritual gifts such as prophesy, vision, praying in tongues, etc. also predisposes a charismatic member to function effectively with this ministry.
            <br><br>National Intercessory Ministry (NIM) is a large family of intercessors nationwide. Under the guidance of National Executive Council of the CCRN, NIM organizes several programs to train intercessors and potential intercessors in serving the Church in the ministry of prophetic intercession in the power of the Holy Spirit. Such programs include National Intercession Training Course, Workshop, Outreach Intercession, Prayer Camping, Rally, etc.
            <br><br> As a body, NIM governs all other units of Praise and Worship Ministry of the Catholic Charismatic Renewal of Nigeria. Such units includes:
            <br><br> PIM - Provincial Intercessory Ministry
            <br><br>DIM - Diocesan (or Archdiocesan) Intercessory Ministry
            <br><br>PGIM - Prayer Group Intercessory Ministry
            <br><br>The NIM is made of diocesan, archdiocesan, and provincial leaders of Intercessory Ministry units across the country. Among the representatives from these units, leaders are often elected to govern the affair of NIM.
