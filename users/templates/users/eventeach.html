        <p>    
            <b>What is teaching ministry? </b>
            It is an organization or group in the ccrn whose major assignment is to see to the growth of the community or church through the teaching and explanation of the word of God. 
            By virtue of our Baptism and Confirmation, we are called to evangelize and proclaim Christ to the world. The goal of the Teaching Ministry is to proclaim the “Kerygma”, which is the basic message of Salvation.
        <br><br>“There is no true evangelization if the name, the teaching, the life, the promises, the kingdom and the ministry of Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of God are not proclaimed” (Evangelii Nuntiandi, Apostolic Exhortation of His Holiness, Pope Paul VI, No.22, 1975)
        <br><br>Members of the teaching Ministry are to teach about the PERSON and MESSAGE of JESUS CHRIST, who is both the messenger and the message. This call to evangelization makes some people to call this ministry ‘Evangelical’ Ministry.
        <br><br>At Prayer Meetings, members of the Teaching Ministry anchors the period allotted tor reading inspired texts from the Scripture, and sharing of a personal sense from the Lord. It’s their role to admonish, instruct, preach or teach within the community. 
        <br><br>TM educates, edifies and continuously feeds the body of Christ with the Word of God. They also meet to organize topics and to make adequate preparation for teaching, one-on-one ministration, as well as public outreach. It is also the duty of the teaching ministry to handles teaching in the Bible Study of the community and the Life in the Spirit seminar.
        <br><br>The tools of the Teaching Ministers are: The Bible, The Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC), Vatican II Documents, Papal Teaching, Writings of the Early Church Fathers, and other Publications of the CCR with nihil obstat and imprimatur.
