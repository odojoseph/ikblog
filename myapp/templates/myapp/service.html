            <h3 style="color: brown">CHASIMATIC LEADERSHIP</h3>        
                <p style="text-align: justify; ">
                The charismatic leader is distinguished from other leaders by his capacity to inspire loyalty toward himself as the 
                source of authority, apart from an established status. Charismatic appeal is validated through the perceptions of the 
                followers. Its possession depends upon the leader's ability to draw upon and manipulate the body of myth in a given culture 
                and the actions and values associated with these myths. Attributes of the charismatic leader tend to vary from society to society. In new states the breakdown of traditional and colonial-legal systems of authority produces conditions of uncertainty conducive to the emergence of charismatic leadership. Through strategies of cultural management, the charismatic leader legitimizes his claims by associating with himself the sacred symbols of the culture. Disintegration of nationalist unity after independence often makes incompatible the simultaneous pursuit of the two goals of political development: the consolidation of the state and the growth of central government capacity to modernize. 
                Charismatic appeal is initially concentrated on and contributes to the achievement of national cohesion.
