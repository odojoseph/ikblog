    <h3 style="color: brown">Beginning of Catholic Charismatic Renual</h3>   
<p>
<b>Catholic Charismatic Renewal</b> is a spiritual movement within the Catholic Church that incorporates aspects of both Catholic and Charismatic Movement practice. It is influenced by some of the teachings of Protestantism and Pentecostalism with an emphasis on having a personal relationship with Jesus and expressing the gifts of the Holy Spirit. 
Parishes that practice charismatic worship usually hold prayer meetings outside of Mass and feature such gifts as prophecy, faith healing, and glossolalia. In Ann Arbor, Michigan, a Catholic church describes charismatic worship as "uplifted hands during songs and audible praying in tongues." It further distinguishes a charismatic congregation as one that emphasises complete surrender to Jesus in all parts of life, obedience to both the Gospel and Catholic teaching, as well as Christ-centered friendships. 
Perceptions of the Charismatic movement vary within the Catholic Church.<br>
Proponents hold the belief that certain charismata (a Greek word for "gifts") are still bestowed by the Holy Spirit today as they were in Early Christianity as described in the Bible. Critics accuse Charismatic Catholics of misinterpreting, or in some cases violating, Church teachings on worship and liturgy. Traditional Catholics, in particular, argue that charismatic practices shift the focus of worship away from reverent communion with Christ in the Eucharist and towards individual emotions and non-liturgical experiences as a substitute.

<h3>Theological Foundations</h3>
<hr>            
    <p>Renewal advocates believe that the charisms identified in Saint Paul's writings, especially in Romans 12:6-8, 
    1 Corinthians 12-14, and Ephesians 4:11-12, continue to exist and to build up the Church (see Catechism of the
    Catholic Church, §2003). The nine charismatic gifts considered extraordinary in character include: faith, 
    expression of knowledge and wisdom, miracles, the gift of tongues and their interpretation, prophecy, discernment 
    of spirits and healing.(1 Corinthians 12:8-10). These gifts are related to the traditional seven gifts of the Holy 
    Spirit described in Isaiah 11:1-2 (wisdom, understanding, counsel, fortitude, knowledge, piety, and fear of the Lord, 
    as listed in Catechism of the Catholic Church, §1831). The nine charismatic gifts in 1 Corinthians 12:8-10 are also related
    to the spiritual and corporal works of mercy. Other references to charisms in the Catechism of the Catholic Church include §§688, 768, 799-801, 890, 951, 1508 (charism of healing) and 2035. The belief that spiritual gifts exist in the present age is called Continuationism.
        </p><br>
    <h3>
    How It Started</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
    In search of a Spiritual experience, professors from Duquesne University, a Catholic university in Pittsburgh, attended the 
    Congress of the Cursillo movement in August 1966. While visiting, they were introduced to the book entitled The Cross and the 
    Switchblade, which emphasized the Holy Spirit and the Spirit’s charisms. This book became the focus of their studies and further led them to pursue the Holy Spirit.
    In January 1967, professors Ralph Keifer and Patrick Bourgeois attended a prayer meeting where they ultimately received the effusion 
    of the Holy Spirit. The following week, Keifer laid hands on other Duquesne professors, and they also had an experience with the Spirit. Then, in February, during a 
    gathering of Duquesne University students at The Ark and The Dove Retreat Center north of Pittsburgh, more people asked Keifer to pray over them. 
    This led to the event at the chapel where they too received the Holy Spirit and spoke in tongues, as well as many other students who were present in the chapel. Keifer sent the news of this event to the University of Notre Dame, where a similar event later occurred, and the Renewal began to spread.
    </p><br>
    <h3>Expansion</h3>
    <hr> 
    <p> Adherents of the movement formed prayer groups called covenant communities. In these communities, members practiced a stronger commitment to spiritual ideals and created documents, or covenants, that set up rules of life. One of the first structured covenant communities was the Word of God Community. It affiliated with the International Communications Office in the 1980s, and its continued growth resulted in a larger overall community called The Sword of the Spirit. The original Word of God Community eventually split from The Sword of the Spirit, however. Of the two original founders of the communities, one stayed with the Word of God and founded an international ministry that reached Eastern Europe and Africa, while the other remained president of the Sword of the Spirit, which as of 2007, had 47 member communities and 16 affiliated communities around the world. 
    <br><br>In addition to the covenant institutions, the Catholic Charismatic Renewal also experienced international development due to missionary priests who experienced the baptism of the Holy Spirit while visiting the United States and implemented their own such services when they returned home. The International Catholic Charismatic Renewal Services had a significant role in the guidance of this form of expansion.
    </p> <br>    
    
    <h3>Catholic Charismatic Renewal Today</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
    As of 2013, the Catholic Charismatic Renewal exists in over 230 countries in the world, with over 160 million members. Participants in the Renewal also cooperate with non-Catholic ecclesiastical communities and other Catholics for ecumenism, as encouraged by the Catholic Church. 
    <br><br>The Charismatic element of the Church is seen as being evident today as it was in the early days of Christianity. Some Catholic Charismatic communities conduct healing services, gospel power services, outreaches and evangelizations where the presence of the Holy Spirit is believed to be felt, and healings and miracles are said to take place. The mission of the Catholic Charismatic Renewal is to educate believers into the totality of the declaration of the gospels. This is done by a personal relationship with Jesus Christ; a one-to-one relationship with Jesus is seen as a possibility by the Charismatic. He is encouraged to talk to Jesus directly and search for what The Lord is saying so that his life will be one with Him; to walk in the Fruit of the Spirit in Galatians 5:22-23, this is what the Charismatic understands by giving their life to Jesus. Conscience is seen as an alternative voice of Jesus Christ. 
    <br><br><b>CCR  GOLDEN JUBILEE 2017 </b><br>
    In response to the invitation of Pope Francis.  ICCRS and Catholic Fraternity are organizing together the Catholic Charismatic Renewal Golden Jubilee event in 2017. The event began on May 31 and celebrations continued until Pentecost Mass on June 4.    
    </p><br>

    <h3>Reaction from the Church Hierarchy</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
    The initial reaction to the movement by the Church hierarchy was cautiously supportive. Some initially supported it as being a harbinger of ecumenism (greater unity of Gospel witness among the different Christian traditions). It was thought that these practices would draw the Catholic Church and Protestant communities closer together in a truly spiritual ecumenism. Today, the Catholic Charismatic Renewal enjoys support from most of the Church's hierarchy, from the Pope to bishops of dioceses around the world, as a recognized ecclesial movement. 
    <br><br>Four popes have acknowledged the movement: Pope Paul VI, Pope John Paul II, Benedict XVI, and Pope Francis. Pope Paul VI acknowledged the movement in 1971 and reaffirmed it in 1975. He went on to say that the movement brought vitality and joy to the Church but also mentioned for people to be discerning of the spirits. Pope John Paul II was also supportive of the Renewal and was in favor of its conservative politics.[1] He (as well as then-Cardinal Ratzinger, Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI) acknowledged good aspects of the movement while urging caution, pointing out that members must maintain their Catholic identity and communion with the Catholic Church. 
    <br><br>Pope John Paul II, in particular, made a number of statements on the movement. On November 30, 1990, The Pontifical Council for the Laity promulgated the decree which inaugurated the Catholic Fraternity of Charismatic Covenant Communities and Fellowships. Brian Smith of Brisbane, elected President of the Executive of the Fraternity, called the declaration the most significant event in the history of the charismatic renewal since the 1975 Holy Year international conference and the acknowledgment it received from Pope Paul VI at that time, saying: "It is the first time that the Renewal has had formal, canonical recognition by the Vatican. 
    <br><br>In March 1992, Pope John Paul II stated
    <br><br>At this moment in the Church's history, the Charismatic Renewal can play a significant role in promoting the much-needed defense of Christian life in societies where secularism and materialism have weakened many people's ability to respond to the Spirit and to discern God's loving call. Your contribution to the re-evangelization of society will be made in the first place by personal witness to the indwelling Spirit and by showing forth His presence through works of holiness and solidarity. 
    <br><br>Moreover, during Pentecost 1998, the Pope recognized the essential nature of the charismatic dimension:
    <br><br>"The institutional and charismatic aspects are co-essential as it were to the Church’s constitution. They contribute, although differently, to the life, renewal and sanctification of God’s People. It is from this providential rediscovery of the Church’s charismatic dimension that, before and after the Council, a remarkable pattern of growth has been established for ecclesial movements and new communities. 
    <br><br>The Papal Preacher, Rev. Fr. Raniero Cantalamessa, has written on the topic numerous times since 1986.            
    </p>
    <br>    
    <h3>Criticism</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
    Charismatic Catholics and their practices have been criticized for distracting Catholics from authentic Church teachings and traditions, especially by making the worship experience more akin to Pentecostal Protestantism. According to Samuel Rodriguez, Charismatic services in America simply help in increasing the number of Catholics converting to Pentecostal and evangelical denominations: “If you are involved in a Charismatic service today, in ten years’ time—inevitably—you are going to end up in one of my churches.”[20] In particular, some traditionalists criticize charismatic Catholics as being crypto-Protestant. 
    <br><br>The Catholic Church teaches that Christ is actually present on the altar in the sacrifice of the Mass, when a priest consecrates bread and wine to become the body and blood of Jesus. Critics of the charismatic movement argue that practices such as faith healing draw attention away from the Mass and the communion with Christ that takes place therein. 
    <br><br>Others criticize the movement for removing or obscuring traditional Catholic symbols (such as the crucifix and Sacred Heart) in favor of more contemporary expressions of faith. 
   
    <h3>Vision of the CCR as declared by ICCRS</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
    ICCRS is an international organisation approved by the HoIy See as a Private Association of the Faithful with a juridical Personality. Its recognition from the Pontifical Council for the Laity Was given on September 14th, 1993. It has its venue in Rome, in Vatican territory, and operates as coordination, information and communication centre to serve the worldwide Catholic Charismatic Renewal (CCR), also making a link between the Movement and the Holy See. 
    <br><br>
    <h3>Vision</h3>
    <br>
    To be ambassadors of the “baptism in the Holy Spirit”, making the Catholic faithful aware of their “charismatic” dimension of life in order to grow in holiness and to serve the Kingdom of God and all the Church.

   <h3 style="color: brown">Catholic Charismatic Renewal In Nigeria</h3>
                   
    <p>The Catholic Charismatic Renewal in Nigeria owes its origin to the Dominican Order. In 1967 the novitiate at Ibadan was opened. By 1969, there were four American Dominicans in the house: Frs. Ed. Riley, Mathias Walsh, Bertrand Ebben and Br. Gilbert Thesing. Another American Dominican, Richard Farmer, was assigned as chaplain to the University of Ife, Ile-Ife.The Catholic Charismatic Renewal in Nigeria owes its origin to the Dominican Order. Fr. Riley had the Baptism in the Holy Spirit when he 
    went on home on leave in 1970. On returning to Nigeria, he gave a talk to the novices about the Catholic Charismatic Renewal.<br><br>
    The interest generated by that talk led to the decision to hold a Pentecost novena in 1971. The novena was concluded on the eve of Pentecost, and the participants, including Frs. Riley and Walsh, Sr. Maura, and Brothers Nonye, Calistus Iheme, Gilbert Thesing, Chukwubikem Okpechi, Clement Tyulen, Jude Mbukanma, John Ekekwe-Nwanze, prayed with one another on Sunday evening. There were no spectacular outcomes from that novena but a weekly prayer meeting followed. Before long, some individuals from outside the Dominican house started participating in the prayer meeting. 
    Among the early lay people that joined the group were, Justina Odogwu, Fred Isichie, Pius Molokwu, Akin Otiko, and Mrs Chinwuba.<br><br>
    The growth of the group was facilitated with the two series of Life in the Spirit Seminars that were organized in 1973. Clear manifestations of charismatic gifts followed. It must be noted that the Prayer Group at the Dominican Institute in Ibadan, which adopted the name ‘Glory Bound Community’ became a watershed for the spread of the Renewal to parishes in and outside the present Archdiocese of Ibadan. Also significant in the history 
    of the Renewal in Nigeria was the starting of a prayer group at the University of Ife (now Obafemi Awolowo University) in October 1972.

    <p>The Catholic Chaplain, Fr. Richard Farmer, O.P., had experienced the ‘Baptism in the Holy Spirit’ earlier that year when he went on leave in the United States. When he invited some staff members and students to a prayer session, none of the persons invited knew what it was all about. Nevertheless, a few people turned up. They included Mr Basil Amaechi, Mr Simeon Malaka, one expatriate female religious, and several students including,
    Fabian Ehikhamenor, Vincent Ekeruche, and Rev. Srs. Evangeline Ezeanya, and Claire Idahosa.<br><br>
    The chairs were arranged in a circle with a big candle in the middle offering a small wavering flame to the classroom. Fr. Farmer led the group in solemn songs of praise and adoration, Bible readings and prayer. That was the beginning of a weekly prayer meeting at the University of Ife. Many participants left the University and carried the torch of the Renewal with them to other places. Fr. Farmer himself played a crucial communication role that took the news about the Renewal across the country. He wrote a column in the weekly Catholic Newspaper The 
    Independent entitled ‘Life in the Spirit’. He also circulated a bulletin entitled Praise God beginning from 1975.<br><br>
    The third prayer group to come into existence was the “Upper Room Community” at St. Dominic’s Parish in Yaba, Lagos. The founding of this group early in 1973 was the work of Frs. Gilbert Thesing, O.P. and Ed Riley, O.P., Sr. Jean of the Medical Missionaries of Mary (MMM), and Bro. Stephen Lucas. For several years, 
    Bro. Stephen Lucas rendered assistance to the prayer group on a weekly basis.<br><br>
    On retiring from the University of Ife, Fr. Farmer was transferred to the parish, where he continued to provide the needed guidance and leadership 
    to the prayer group. The growth of this group was far more spectacular than those of the two earlier groups. The impact of the Renewal in the parish 
    was quite tremendous, sending ripples to other parishes. The Catholic Church in Nigeria was obviously ready for the Renewal, and indeed prayer groups started springing up in quick successions across the country. One started in Gusau at our Lady of Fatima Church in Sokoto Diocese in September 1973. The prayer group at SS Peter and Paul Major Seminary, 
    Ibadan, was started about October the same year by the students who had been attending the prayer meeting at the Dominican Community, Ibadan. The role of that prayer group in the history of the Renewal in Nigeria has been very significant, especially in producing priests that are active in the Renewal. Before the end of 1973, a number of prayer groups sprang up in other places in 
    Nigeria, including Uturu, Okigwe, Benin City, Onitsha, and Kano. From October 1974, the history of the Renewal in Nigeria entered a new phase.<br><br>
    At the invitation of Fr Ebben, O.P., a team of five Americans visited Nigeria and conducted workshops on the Charismatic Renewal and healing ministry in Ibadan, Benin City, Onitsha, and at the University of Ife. One beautiful thing about the team was its ecumenical thrust. It comprised Catholics, including Fr. McNutt (the leader), Sr. Jeanne Hill, Fr. Gus Biehl, Fr. John Healey, and a Methodist, Rev Joe Petree. Many people, both clergy and lay faithful, attended the workshops and healing sessions 
    and contributed to the growing awareness about the Renewal. A rapid proliferation of prayer groups and growth of membership followed. This growth was not without some problems. Some non-Catholics that joined the prayer groups and Catholics who participated in non-Catholic fellowships precipitated doctrinal controversies. A few prayer groups had to be closed down across the country. 
    Nevertheless, the Catholic Church in Nigeria, recognizing the positive potential of the Renewal, gave cautious support to it. In order to enhance the relationship and communication between it and the Renewal, the Catholic Bishops’
        Conference of Nigeria, in 1977, appointed the Bishop of Benin Diocese, Rt. Rev. Dr. Patrick Ekpu, as the Episcopal Liaison for the Renewal. Another landmark event in the Renewal in Nigeria was the First National Leaders’ Conference held in Benin City in August 1976.<br><br>
        The high point of the conference was the decision to create the National Advisory Council and the National Service Board for the Renewal in Nigeria. The former was to be the national policy making body. It was to serve as a coordinating and advisory body as well as a bridge between the Renewal and the Catholic Bishops Conference. The National Service Board was to be the executive organ of the Renewal. 
        A National Service Centre, headed by a director, had earlier been created to serve as the secretariat of the Renewal and to provide various services such as communication and distribution of literature and cassettes. The first director, Fr. Ebben O.P., was in office from 1974 to 1978. He operated from Funtua in present-day Katsina State. He was assisted by Mr. Paul Anie, who later succeeded him and moved with the Centre to Ibadan, and then to Benin City. Fr. Jude Mbukanma, O.P. took over from Paul Anie in 1983 and operated from the Dominican Community for the duration of his tenure. 
        By the time he left office in 1989, the Renewal had become a dominant force in the Catholic Church in Nigeria. It was during his tenure that Bishop Anthony Gbuji of Issele-Uku Diocese donated acres of land at Ubulu-Uku to the Renewal for the site of the National Service Centre. There were also regional champions among the clergy and religions, who contributed a great deal to the growth of the Renewal. These included Fr. Jim Birmingham in Lagos, Frs. G. Abiebhode and Bob Dundon in Benin, Fr. Matthew Obiukwu in Onitsha and Rev. Sr. Terence in Yelwa in Sokoto Diocese.<br><br>
        The period 1989 to 1996 was that of structural changes in the Renewal in Nigeria at the national level. Bishop Gabriel G. Ganaka of the Diocese of Jos had succeeded Bishop Ekpu as the Episcopal Liaison and National Chaplain, a position he held until his death in 2000. In 1989, Fr. Stephen Nagba took up a national coordinating role in succession to Fr. Mbukanma, not as Director of the National Service Centre but as National Coordinator. In effect, the office of the Director of National Service Centre became vacant until it was 
        re-designated as that of ‘Executive Secretary’ with Mr. Francis Mary-Okwum, as the first incumbent from March 1996. Within the same period, the national policy-making body, the National Advisory Council (NAC), and its executive arm went through a process of redefinition and restructuring.<br><br>
        The name National Advisory Council was changed to National Administrative Council and later to National Service Team. The National Service Board became the National Executive Committee (NEC). The diocesan chaplains who had been a prominent voice in NAC formed the Committee of Chaplains.

        As a pious movement of the Holy Spirit within the Catholic Church, CCRN achieves her aim and object 

        The Catholic Charismatic Renewal started in February 1967 in Duquesne University, Pennsylvania, USA. Like a grain of mustard seed, it has spread all over the world with a membership of about 115 million Catholics. It was birthed by the Holy Spirit and its growth has been powered by the Holy Spirit.
        The Catholic Charismatic Renewal of Nigeria (CCRN) is a lay organization which started in Nigeria in 1967. Within her 50 years of existence, she has spread to virtually all the parishes in the nine Archdioceses, forty-four Dioceses, and two Vicariates of the Nigerian Church. Using our most recent information, she has about 2,100 Prayer Groups (PG) and Coordinators, four hundred and forty-four executives of theDiocesan Service Team (DST), 
        seventy two leaders of the Provincial Service Team (PST), and over 250,000 members across the country.
        The Administrative structure of the CCRN starts from the PG Service Team to the DST, PST, and finally the National Service Team (NST) under the governance of the National Executive Council (NEC), which is the highest governing body of the organization in Nigeria.
        <br><br>
        <b>OUR VISION AND MISSION</b>
        <br>
        The vision and mission of the Renewal are expressed in its aims and objectives, as stated by the International Catholic Charismatic Renewal Services (ICCRS):
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>To foster mature and continuous personal conversion to Jesus Christ our Lord and Saviour.</li>
            <li>To foster a decisive personal receptivity to the person, presence and power of the Holy Spirit. These two spiritual graces are often received together in what is called in different parts of the 
                world a baptism in the Holy Spirit, or a release of the Holy Spirit, or a renewal of the Holy Spirit. They are often understood as a personal acceptance of the graces of Christian initiation and as an empowering for personal Christian service in the Church and in the world.</li>
            <li>To foster the reception and use of the spiritual gifts (charismata) not only in the CCR but also in the broader Church. These gifts, ordinary and extraordinary, are abundantly found among the laity, religious and clergy. Their proper understanding and use in harmony with other elements 
                of the Church life is a source of strength for Christians on their journey towards holiness and in carrying out their mission.</li>
            <li>To foster the work of evangelisation in the power of the Holy Spirit, including the evangelisation of the unchurched, the re-evangelisation of nominal Christians, the evangelisation of culture and social structures. 
                CCR especially promotes sharing the Church’s mission by proclaiming the gospel in word and deed and by bearing witness to Jesus Christ through personal testimony and through those works of faith and justice to which each one is called.</li>
            <li>To foster the ongoing growth in holiness through the proper integration of these charismatic emphases with the full life of the Church. This is accomplished through participation in a rich sacramental and liturgical life, and appreciation of the tradition of the Catholic prayer and spirituality, and ongoing formation in Catholic doctrine. This is guided by the Church’s Magisterium, 
                and participation in the pastoral plan of the Church.</li>
            </ol>   
            <br><br>
            <b>OUR SPIRITUALITY</b><br>
            To remain faithful to her spirituality, CCRN put in place activities that would start, sustain, and spread the fire of the Holy Spirit (cf. 2 Timothy 1:7). Such activities include: Prayers, Bible Studies, Seminars and Workshops, Fellowship, Teachings, Conferences, Exercising the Gifts, and a Life of Witnessing.
            <br><br>
            <b>Charismatic Spirituality </b> centers on ‘Life in the Spirit’ that transform members inside out and dispose them to the searching sword of the Word of God, the truth that sets free, and to the anointing of the Spirit. This spirituality revolves around ones fruitful response to the Holy Spirit, and His Gifts, by commitment to Jesus and the Catholic Church.
            <br><br>
            Charismatic Spirituality goes beyond frenzied gathering characterized by outbursts, shouting and clapping, prophetic utterances and healing. It extend to acts that build the faith of here members based on free, conscious, and personal choice.
            <br>
            By virtue of the ‘Charism’ of her foundation, the Catholic Charismatic Renewal movement is destined to be militant, god as sentinel or combatant soldiers in rescue operations. So, members of the Renewal engage in the battle of faith against the wicked principalities and power at work in this life (cf. Ephesian 6:12). 
            One’s membership into the Catholic Charismatic Renewal begins with participation in “Life in the Spirit Seminar”, which aims at teaching members the basis truth of our faith and lead them to personal relationship with Christ.
            <br>
            The Catholic Charismatic Renewal is a movement of the Holy Spirit. For Human action is deified
            <br>
            <ul>

    <!-- Catholic Charismatic Renewal In Awka Diocese -->
    
    <h3 style="color: brown"> Catholic Charismatic Renewal Awka Diocese</h3>
                   
    <p>
    <!-- <b>Catholic Charismatic Renewal</b> is a spiritual movement within the Catholic Church that incorporates aspects of both Catholic and Charismatic Movement practice. It is influenced by some of the teachings of Protestantism and Pentecostalism with an emphasis on having a personal relationship with Jesus and expressing the gifts of the Holy Spirit. 
    Parishes that practice charismatic worship usually hold prayer meetings outside of Mass and feature such gifts as prophecy, faith healing, and glossolalia. In Ann Arbor, Michigan, a Catholic church describes charismatic worship as "uplifted hands during songs and audible praying in tongues." It further distinguishes a charismatic congregation as one that emphasises complete surrender to Jesus in all parts of life, obedience to both the Gospel and Catholic teaching, as well as Christ-centered friendships. 
    Perceptions of the Charismatic movement vary within the Catholic Church.<br>
    Proponents hold the belief that certain charismata (a Greek word for "gifts") are still bestowed by the Holy Spirit today as they were in Early Christianity as described in the Bible. Critics accuse Charismatic Catholics of misinterpreting, or in some cases violating, Church teachings on worship and liturgy. Traditional Catholics, in particular, argue that charismatic practices shift the focus of worship away from reverent communion with Christ in the Eucharist and towards individual emotions and non-liturgical experiences as a substitute. -->

    <!-- <h3>Theological Foundations</h3>
    <hr>            
        <p>Renewal advocates believe that the charisms identified in Saint Paul's writings, especially in Romans 12:6-8, 
        1 Corinthians 12-14, and Ephesians 4:11-12, continue to exist and to build up the Church (see Catechism of the
        Catholic Church, §2003). The nine charismatic gifts considered extraordinary in character include: faith, 
        expression of knowledge and wisdom, miracles, the gift of tongues and their interpretation, prophecy, discernment 
        of spirits and healing.(1 Corinthians 12:8-10). These gifts are related to the traditional seven gifts of the Holy 
        Spirit described in Isaiah 11:1-2 (wisdom, understanding, counsel, fortitude, knowledge, piety, and fear of the Lord, 
        as listed in Catechism of the Catholic Church, §1831). The nine charismatic gifts in 1 Corinthians 12:8-10 are also related
        to the spiritual and corporal works of mercy. Other references to charisms in the Catechism of the Catholic Church include §§688, 768, 799-801, 890, 951, 1508 (charism of healing) and 2035. The belief that spiritual gifts exist in the present age is called Continuationism.
            </p><br>
        <h3>
        How It Started</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
        In search of a Spiritual experience, professors from Duquesne University, a Catholic university in Pittsburgh, attended the 
        Congress of the Cursillo movement in August 1966. While visiting, they were introduced to the book entitled The Cross and the 
        Switchblade, which emphasized the Holy Spirit and the Spirit’s charisms. This book became the focus of their studies and further led them to pursue the Holy Spirit.
        In January 1967, professors Ralph Keifer and Patrick Bourgeois attended a prayer meeting where they ultimately received the effusion 
        of the Holy Spirit. The following week, Keifer laid hands on other Duquesne professors, and they also had an experience with the Spirit. Then, in February, during a 
        gathering of Duquesne University students at The Ark and The Dove Retreat Center north of Pittsburgh, more people asked Keifer to pray over them. 
        This led to the event at the chapel where they too received the Holy Spirit and spoke in tongues, as well as many other students who were present in the chapel. Keifer sent the news of this event to the University of Notre Dame, where a similar event later occurred, and the Renewal began to spread.
        </p><br>
        <h3>Expansion</h3>
        <hr> 
        <p> Adherents of the movement formed prayer groups called covenant communities. In these communities, members practiced a stronger commitment to spiritual ideals and created documents, or covenants, that set up rules of life. One of the first structured covenant communities was the Word of God Community. It affiliated with the International Communications Office in the 1980s, and its continued growth resulted in a larger overall community called The Sword of the Spirit. The original Word of God Community eventually split from The Sword of the Spirit, however. Of the two original founders of the communities, one stayed with the Word of God and founded an international ministry that reached Eastern Europe and Africa, while the other remained president of the Sword of the Spirit, which as of 2007, had 47 member communities and 16 affiliated communities around the world. 
        <br><br>In addition to the covenant institutions, the Catholic Charismatic Renewal also experienced international development due to missionary priests who experienced the baptism of the Holy Spirit while visiting the United States and implemented their own such services when they returned home. The International Catholic Charismatic Renewal Services had a significant role in the guidance of this form of expansion.
        </p> <br>    
        
        <h3>Catholic Charismatic Renewal Today</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
        As of 2013, the Catholic Charismatic Renewal exists in over 230 countries in the world, with over 160 million members. Participants in the Renewal also cooperate with non-Catholic ecclesiastical communities and other Catholics for ecumenism, as encouraged by the Catholic Church. 
        <br><br>The Charismatic element of the Church is seen as being evident today as it was in the early days of Christianity. Some Catholic Charismatic communities conduct healing services, gospel power services, outreaches and evangelizations where the presence of the Holy Spirit is believed to be felt, and healings and miracles are said to take place. The mission of the Catholic Charismatic Renewal is to educate believers into the totality of the declaration of the gospels. This is done by a personal relationship with Jesus Christ; a one-to-one relationship with Jesus is seen as a possibility by the Charismatic. He is encouraged to talk to Jesus directly and search for what The Lord is saying so that his life will be one with Him; to walk in the Fruit of the Spirit in Galatians 5:22-23, this is what the Charismatic understands by giving their life to Jesus. Conscience is seen as an alternative voice of Jesus Christ. 
        <br><br><b>CCR  GOLDEN JUBILEE 2017 </b><br>
        In response to the invitation of Pope Francis.  ICCRS and Catholic Fraternity are organizing together the Catholic Charismatic Renewal Golden Jubilee event in 2017. The event began on May 31 and celebrations continued until Pentecost Mass on June 4.

        <h3>Reaction from the Church Hierarchy</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
        <br><br>Others criticize the movement for removing or obscuring traditional Catholic symbols (such as the crucifix and Sacred Heart) in favor of more contemporary expressions of faith.  -->

        <!-- Saviours Will Prayer Group -->

       <h3 style="color: brown">History of Saviours Will Prayer Group</h3>
        <p>
        The history of Saviour's Will Prayer Group as presently constituted, dates back to 1980, when it started as a small Bible Society, 
        with Bros. Michael Okafor .1., Gabriel Obiora, Charles Chirvr.ira. Bernard Eze, Charles Ezekunie and Raymond Mary Eze, Rev. Fr. Ignatius Uko, then a seminarian on Apostolic work, and late Monsignor Ambrose Orjiakor among others, as its pioneer members. 
        The Bible Society met every Thursday, at 4:00 pm for Bible discussions, under the surveillance of Rev. Fr. Ignatius Uko, a seminarian on apostolic work then. The small Bible Society continued their meetings in a small hall until the events that led to 
        the dramatic growth and expansion through the influence of Charismatic . Renewal under Monsignor Obiukwu at Sacred Heart Parish, Odoakpu Onitsha. 
        This experience made the members to start attending vigils at Sacred Heart Parish, Odoakpu Onitsha, every last Saturday of the month.

        <div id="parish1" class="collapse "><br>         
            <p>
        At the vigils at Onitsha, members were able to learn some Charismatic features arid attribute such shouting Alleluia, and singing and praising God in the Church, with claps and dances. The propagation of these key soul – lifting
        religious practices encountered serious verbal attacks and criticisms from both the religious and lay people alike. But, to the glory of God, the Renewal survived those turbulent moments and kept soaring even higher.       
        <br><br>The Bible Society was transformed to Catholic Charismatic Renewal after some periods of renewals and trails of the Holy Ghost wind. Throughout the years, the Prayer Group passed through some periods of transformations in the light of 
        the gospel from both the priests and lay people alike. Despite these periods of transformations and restructurings, the Prayer Community has continued to grow in leaps and bounds to the glory of God.

    <p>It is worthy of note that the Saviour's Will Prayer Group, Catholic Charismatic Renewal has witnessed varieties of leadership 
    styles from her cream of adherents over the years, who have served the Renewal in various capacities and at different levels. 
    Their leadership styles have been appraised by individuals based on personal sentiments, perceptions and thought trend. 
    Nevertheless, in spite of all the appraisal yardsticks, one outstanding fact remains that leadership after leadership has been 
    visionary, dynamic, charismatic and pro - active. These are instrumental -to the height the Community has attained so far.

            Saviour's Will Prayer Group, Catholic Charismatic Renewal, St. Patrick's Cathedral Parish, Awka has undergone a series of turbulent times since its inception in the year 1980. 
            Through faith and perseverance, successive Leaderships of the prayer community have been able to surmount all the difficulties encountered on the way to this present time. 
            Hence, we would want to advance our already started struggles to effect changes, proclaim, propagate and promote the good news of Christ in all the nook and cranny of the earth.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the 28th of August, 2013, we made an appeal to his Lordship, Most Rev. Dr. P.C. Ezeokafor, requesting for a space of land to erect a conference hall for our daily/weekly activities and prayer meetings within the cathedral parish. 
            This appeal of ours was borne out of serious concern for the growth of the body of Christ. The uncompleted Cathedral Parish Hall we occupied prior to this request has accommodated us over the years and served for our multifarious needs. 
            In their bid to complete the building, the Parish Pastoral Council, through the Cathedral Administrator, notified us to start making alternate arrangements on where we shall stay for our programmes when the hall is eventually completed.
        </p>
        <p>
            People from all works of life were invited to St. Patrick's Cathedral, Awka on Sunday, 29th November, 2015 for the occasion of the launching of our Sixty Million Naira, Ultra Modern Fellowship Hall Complex by Saviour's Will Prayer Group, 
            Catholic Charismatic Renewal of Nigeria, St. Patrick's Cathedral Parish, Awka. With the Chief hosts, Most Rev. Dr. Paulinus Ezeokafor, the Catholic Bishop of Awka and Most Rev. Dr. Jonas Benson Okoye, the Auxiliary Bishop of Awka; and under 
            the chairmanship of Hon. Robert Egenti (Senior Special Adviser to the Executive Governor of Anambra State on Accounts), the Launching Programme could not yield the anticipated results due to some unforeseen circumstances.

            <h3>2016 REGIME</h3>
        <p>
            Saviour's Will Prayer Group is made up of seven (7) key ministries. These ministries were fashioned out based on the varied spiritual gifts of the members who yearn to serve God and humanities in their various capacities with those gifts. 
            Another yardstick used in operating through these ministries is the daily spiritual, physical, emotional and psychological demands of the time and events. These Ministries are usually headed by the members of the Service Team, who gives timely reports on the challenges of those ministries and organizes trainings and seminars to enable the members of his/her ministry to fully understand their callings to respond appropriately. The existing ministries and their leaders are as follows:

            In the New Members Group A class, candidates are drilled on the most elementary notions of Christianity such as the Rosary, Catechisms, 
            Trinitarian God with more emphasis on the Holy Spirit and other Christian concepts as contained in their syllabuses. The brethren in group B are prepared for the periodic enrollment in the various Ministries of their callings after they must have scaled through the compulsory examinations.
