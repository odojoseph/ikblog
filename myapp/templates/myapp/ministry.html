<hr>
<img src="{% static 'teaching.jpg' %}" alt="Teachers" width="70%" height="300px" style="float: left; padding-right:20px">
<p>     <b>TEACHING MINISTRY IN THE CCRN.</b> <i>Ephesians 4:11, Acts 6:4</i><br>
        <b>What is teaching ministry? </b>
        It is an organization or group in the ccrn whose major assignment is to see to the growth of the community or church through the teaching and explanation of the word of God. 
        By virtue of our Baptism and Confirmation, we are called to evangelize and proclaim Christ to the world. The goal of the Teaching Ministry is to proclaim the “Kerygma”, which is the basic message of Salvation.
<br><br>“There is no true evangelization if the name, the teaching, the life, the promises, the kingdom and the ministry of Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of God are not proclaimed” (Evangelii Nuntiandi, Apostolic Exhortation of His Holiness, Pope Paul VI, No.22, 1975)
<br><br>Members of the teaching Ministry are to teach about the PERSON and MESSAGE of JESUS CHRIST, who is both the messenger and the message. This call to evangelization makes some people to call this ministry ‘Evangelical’ Ministry.
<br><br>At Prayer Meetings, members of the Teaching Ministry anchors the period allotted tor reading inspired texts from the Scripture, and sharing of a personal sense from the Lord. It’s their role to admonish, instruct, preach or teach within the community. 
<br><br>TM educates, edifies and continuously feeds the body of Christ with the Word of God. They also meet to organize topics and to make adequate preparation for teaching, one-on-one ministration, as well as public outreach. It is also the duty of the teaching ministry to handles teaching in the Bible Study of the community and the Life in the Spirit seminar.
<br><br>The tools of the Teaching Ministers are: The Bible, The Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC), Vatican II Documents, Papal Teaching, Writings of the Early Church Fathers, and other Publications of the CCR with nihil obstat and imprimatur.

        <h3>Intercessory Ministry</h3>
        <hr>    
        <p>
            Intercession, being at the heart of evangelization and mission, is well rooted in the Catholic tradition. It concerns all Christians, not just those who are members of the Catholic Charismatic Renewal of Nigeria. As St. Paul enjoins the Ephesians Christian community to “Pray in the Spirit at all times in every prayer and supplication.” (Ep 6:18). Meanwhile, in the Catholic Charismatic Renewal, the Intercessory Ministry (IM) is specially carved out to show commitment to this sacred duty.
            <!-- <img src="{% static 'aust.png' %}" alt="Intercessors" width="50%" height="300px" style="float: right; padding-right:20px" /> -->
            <br><br>Ministries at other levels of the Renewal, such as ‘Healing Ministry’, ‘Deliverance Ministry’, and ‘Praying Ministry’, fall under the STEWARD MINISTRY, and their members to be known as ‘intercessors’. Their role in the CCRN is to PRAY, not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others - specifically for the Church and for the world at large. At Prayer Meetings, members of this ministry anchors the period allotted for praying for intercessions and particular needs of people.
            <br><br>This ministry requires members who are committed to growth in holiness, love for Personal Prayer, Word of God, Sacraments and Fellowship, and a continuous disposition to a intimate communion with God. Spiritual gifts such as prophesy, vision, praying in tongues, etc. also predisposes a charismatic member to function effectively with this ministry.
            <img src="{% static 'praying2.png' %}" alt="Intercessors" width="70%" height="300px" style="float: left; padding-right:20px">
            <br><br>National Intercessory Ministry (NIM) is a large family of intercessors nationwide. Under the guidance of National Executive Council of the CCRN, NIM organizes several programs to train intercessors and potential intercessors in serving the Church in the ministry of prophetic intercession in the power of the Holy Spirit. Such programs include National Intercession Training Course, Workshop, Outreach Intercession, Prayer Camping, Rally, etc.
            <br><br> As a body, NIM governs all other units of Praise and Worship Ministry of the Catholic Charismatic Renewal of Nigeria. Such units includes:
            <br><br> PIM - Provincial Intercessory Ministry
            <br><br>DIM - Diocesan (or Archdiocesan) Intercessory Ministry
            <br><br>PGIM - Prayer Group Intercessory Ministry
            <br><br>The NIM is made of diocesan, archdiocesan, and provincial leaders of Intercessory Ministry units across the country. Among the representatives from these units, leaders are often elected to govern the affair of NIM.

    <h3>Visitation Ministry</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
            It is a mistaken notion to regard a ministry to the individual as something separate and distinct from regular pastoral duties."
            <br><br>"The burden of Jesus' lifework too was a ministry to men and women one by one. . . . The record of the Master's life is made up mostly of personal contacts." '
            <!-- <img src="{% static 'aust.png' %}" alt="Visitation Ministers" width="50%" height="300px" style="float: right; padding-right:20px"> -->
            <br><br>These two comments by John Sutherland Bonne11 come directly to the heart of pastoral responsibility in spiritual counseling, and the importance of the ministry of visitation.
            <br><br>A person is fortunate indeed when he dis¬covers Jesus' way of doing anything. It is not necessary to read very far in the Gospels before one comes to the conclusion that Jesus never depended only on a series of meetings to win or convert His hearers on the spot. He preached —and no one will ever preach as Jesus did—but when it came to the specific task of winning His followers, He either went to them or called them to Him." Certainly we would do well to imitate the Master Teacher.
            <br><br>The sole purpose of the ministry is to spread the contagion of Christian ideals, and it has been demonstrated again and again that this can best be done through personal fellowship or visitation. The minister should visit with the people in their homes. He should acquaint him¬self with their problems and their needs, rally¬ing them to faithfulness in church attendance and in Christian service, and coming close to the lambs of the flock. This he must do per¬sonally because "there is no substitute for heart-to-heart personal work."'
            <br><br>Surely the work of the minister does not end when a person is baptized, for it is his work to strengthen the spiritual life of each church mem¬ber. Even as it is considered dishonorable for a parent to bring a child into the world and
            neglect to properly feed and care for him, so it should be unthinkable for the minister to bring a new "child" into the faith and then fail to provide the spiritual food and direction that he needs.' "Souls for whom Christ died are perish¬ing for want of well-directed personal labor; and he has mistaken his calling who, having entered the ministry, is unwilling to do the personal work that the care of the flock de-mands."
            <br><br>The tragic story is told of a church member who pleaded with her pastor for a year to talk with her daughter who had begun to drift from the faith. After the girl had been left to drift for twelve months, the pastor casually asked her whether she attended worldly places of amuse¬ment. Learning that she did, the pastor informed her that that was against our standards, and that she would be dropped from church fellowship. And she was.' One cannot help wondering whether the outcome might not have been en¬tirely different had the pastor fulfilled his obli¬gation as "shepherd of the flock" by calling upon this girl and seeking to guide her in a friendly manner. Suppose that at least a dozen times during those twelve months he had pleaded with that girl to give her heart com¬pletely to God; suppose that he had prayed with her each time; suppose that he had ar¬ranged for other young people of the church to surround that girl with Christian influences con¬tinually; then perhaps the story would have had a happier ending.
            <br><br>Again it was reported that a woman, owing to circumstances beyond her control, had been unable to attend church for several months, but she had remained faithful to her baptismal vows. One weekday the pastor and the local elder called on her at her work, a job which she could not leave even to visit with them. They reported back to the church that she was no longer interested, and shortly afterward she received a notice that her name had been dropped from the church record.' One likes to think of the minister as one who is a master of good human relationships. Yet it appears that these persons had mastered the art of "inhuman relationships."
            <br><br>It is true that the minister is busily engaged in the functions of the church and in seeking to win new converts, but never should he neglect one of the lambs of the flock who has begun to stray. When the Chief Shepherd learned that one lamb was missing, He left the ninety and nine safe in the fold and went out and searched for that lamb till He found it. He didn't say that it would be cheaper or easier to buy an-other lamb, nor did He scold or condemn the lamb when He found it, but gently He held it to His breast and carried it back to the fold. There He tenderly bathed its wounds and loved it back into the fold. So the minister must care for the lambs of the spiritual flock. Too often he feels that his sole work is preaching beautiful sermons, but he will never really win the hearts of his people so long as be has a pulpit between him and them. It is granted that he might be considered a good preacher or lecturer, but never a shepherd.
            <br><br>In order for a minister to be truly successful he must make his parishioners his best friends, and he should be their best friend. "This rela¬tionship can exist in every church. The minister can kindle a spiritual warmth in his member¬ship by preparing a calling list and then visiting all his church members. In talking to them about their home, their children, and their relationship to God he will gain their confi¬dence and love. By praying with them he can make the family feel that they have been drawn closer to God and man."
            <br><br> We do well to heed this valuable counsel on this point:
            <br><br>Those who labor for God have but just begun the work when they have given a discourse in the desk. After this comes the real labor, the visiting from house to house, conversing with members of families, praying with them, and coming close in sympathy to those whom we wish to benefit. It will not detract from the dignity of a minister of Christ to be awake to see and realize the temporal bur¬dens and cares of the family he visits.
            <br><br>So the importance of the personal ministry of visitation can never be overemphasized. Jesus went out and talked with the people in their homes. Men today, who are seeking public office, make it a point to go out and meet the man on the street to demonstrate that they have a personal interest in him. Surely the minister of the gospel can do no less in his important work of seeking to "present every man perfect in Christ Jesus." "
            </p><hr />

<h3>Evangelical Ministry</h3>
<hr>
<p>Within Christianity, evangelical ministry is a ministry whose chief aim is to win converts to Christ. A minister who is involved primarily in evangelistic ministry is called an evangelist. In addition to vocational evangelists, Catholic Charismatic Renewal trains and  encourage their people to become involved in evangelistic ministry by sharing their faith with others.
</p>
<img src="{% static 'evan.jpg' %}" alt="Praise Worship Ministers" width="70%" height="300px" style="float: left; padding-right:20px">
<p>In the Bible, the word evangelist comes from the Greek word "evangelion," which means "to bring good news." While evangelistic ministries use a wide range of methodologies, they all focus on one basic task: proclaiming the gospel -- or "good news." Christian denominations differ in their exact definition of what proclaiming the gospel entails, but all evangelism -- regardless of the denomination -- is designed to draw people to follow Christ.</p>
<p>The primary responsibility is to preach God's Word, telling people simply and clearly what God says concerning His Son Jesus Christ and what He has done for all. This is done with urgency because the souls of people are at stake. ... God has given the message and the evangelist is to be faithful to every word.</p>
<hr />
    
<h3>Steward Ministry</h3><hr>
        <p>
         Just like the first Christian Community founded by the Apostles, the Catholic Charismatic Renewal of Nigeria pay special attention to the physical and emotional wellbeing of her members, and ensures that all necessary arrangements are put in place for her members to conveniently encounter God in the Word, Prayers, Praise and Worship. Thus, the task of planning, preparing, arranging, monitoring, and facilitating her activities are often entrusted to the members of the Steward Ministry. 
            <br><br>The Steward Ministry is at the heart of the Catholic Charismatic Renewal, and it is made up CCRN members who are supportive, welcoming, trustful, reliable, friendly, enthusiastic about service and sensitive to the needs of others. They are individuals who deploy God’s gifts (their time, talent, treasure, bodies, friendships, natural resources, and beauty) to the Service of God. It is pertinent to know that a true call to a life of commitment and service can only come to an individual through the Sacrament of Baptism and Confirmation, for the Spirit empowers us to like Jesus who came not to be served but to serve. Stewards are called to imitate Jesus’ life and His love.
            <br><br>At Prayer Group level, the members of this ministry caters for the physical needs of members, arrange venue for fellowship, contact absent members, welcome new members, and look after the wellbeing of all members. At the diocesan, archdiocesan, provincial or national level, they fix and arrange venue for crusades, conferences, camping, workshops or any program. They also ensure the security of the venue used for our Charismatic events. The role of the Steward Ministry enables our community to be filled with grace, love, and unity.
            <img src="{% static 'steward.jpg' %}" alt="Steward Ministers" width="60%" height="300px" style="float: right; padding-right:20px">
            <br><br>Members of the Stewards Ministry play dynamic role of service depending on the should be noted that titles such as ‘Welfare Ministry’, ‘Greater Ministry’, and ‘Visitation Ministry’ all fall under the STEWARD MINISTRY as recognized at the National Level of the CCRN
            <br><br>The National Stewards Ministry (NSM) is made up of stewards with varying skills, professions, and talents, selected from different dioceses, archdiocese, and provinces across the country. At CCRN National programs, some serves as ushers, security, technicians, protocol, while others serves as organizers, planners, project managers, hosts, and information personnel within the Catholic Charismatic Renewal of Nigeria. 
            <br><br>Ministries at other levels of the Renewal, such as ‘Welfare Ministry’, ‘Greater Ministry’, and ‘Visitation Ministry’, fall under the STEWARD MINISTRY and their activities are being regulated by NSM, under the guidance of National Executive Council of the CCRN.
            <br><br>NSM organizes several programs to stewards at all other units of Steward Ministry of the Catholic Charismatic Renewal of Nigeria. Such units includes:
            <br><br>PSM - Provincial Steward Ministry
            <br><br>DSM - Diocesan (or Archdiocesan) Steward Ministry
            <br><br>PGSM - Prayer Group Steward Ministry        
        </p><hr />
   

<h3>Praise and Worship Ministry</h3><hr>
<p>
        Whenever the members of CCRN come together into God’s presence, the task of leading praise and worship is assigned to this ministry. The Renewal deploys Praises and thanksgiving at her gathering since this is a form of prayer that recognizes most immediately that God is God. While thanksgiving brings us through the gates of God’s throne, Praise brings us straight into God’s Court (cf. Isaiah 60:18).
        <br><br>The fact that Praise and Worship is an essential element of our Charismatic gathering (for fellowship, workshop, meetings, conference, training, etc.) shows the importance of this ministry within the CCRN.
        <img src="{% static 'praise.jpg' %}" alt="Praise Worship Ministers" width="70%" height="300px" style="float: left; padding-right:20px">
        <br><br>Praise and Worship Ministry (PWM) is tasked with leading our worship during prayer meetings, crusades, conferences and conventions. They skillfully combines biblical truth with music to magnify the worth of God and the redemptive work of Jesus Christ, thereby motivating the gathered members of the renewal to join them in proclaiming and cherishing the truth about God and seeking to live all of life for the glory of God. PWM’s entire activities aim at leading people into God’s presence.
        <br><br>Members of Praise and Worship Ministry anchors the time allotted for praise and exuberant songs, and lead others into deeper worship or singing in the Spirit. It is expected that members of this ministry be gifted with voice or skills in playing musical instruments.
        <br><br>The National Praise and Worship Ministry (NPWM), under the guidance of the National Executive Council, regulate the affairs, activities, and modus operandi of this ministry across the Nation. As a body, NPWM governs all other units of Praise and Worship Ministry of the Catholic Charismatic Renewal of Nigeria. Such units includes:
        <br><br>PPWM - Provincial Praise and Worship Ministry
        <br><br>DPWM - Diocesan (or Archdiocesan) Praise and Worship Ministry
        <br><br>PGPW - Prayer Group Praise and Worship Ministry
        <br><br>The NPWM is made of diocesan, archdiocesan, and provincial leaders of Praise and Worship Ministry units across the country. Among the representatives from these units, leaders are often elected to govern the affair of NPWM.
